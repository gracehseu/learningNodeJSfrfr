    <h3>Hi, I'm Grace.</h3>
    <body>
        Iâ€™m a software engineer working in the finance industry who is passionate about good software engineering practices and back-end software engineering.
        I graduated from University of Texas at Austin with degrees in CS & math. 
        When I'm not programming at work you can find me making games or developing tools. In my free time, you can find me gaming, reading a good book, or shopping.
